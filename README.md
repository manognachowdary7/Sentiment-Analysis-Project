# Sentiment-Analysis-Project
This repository contains the code and resources for sentiment analysis on financial text data using the FIQA and Financial Phrase Bank datasets.
## Overview
The project focuses on analyzing the sentiment expressed in financial text data to extract insights valuable for investors and analysts. The analysis involves preprocessing textual data, feature extraction, model training, evaluation and deployment.
## Dependencies
1. Python
1. nltk
1. pandas
1. matplotlib
1. seaborn
1. scikit-learn
1. vaderSentiment
1. streamlit
## Project Steps
### Step 1: Data Preparation and Exploration
- Clean the text data to remove noise and irrelevant information.
- Conduct frequency analysis on the text data before removing stopwords to understand the distribution of words.
- Remove stopwords to eliminate common words that do not contribute much to the sentiment analysis.
- Visualize the frequency of words after removing stopwords to observe the impact on word distribution.
### Step 2: Feature Engineering and Visualization
- Tokenize the text to break it down into individual words or tokens.
- Perform lemmatization to reduce words to their base or root form.
- Analyze bigrams and trigrams to understand the relationships between words.
- Visualize sentiments using pie charts to provide an overview of sentiment distribution.
- Create word clouds to visually represent the most frequent words in the dataset.
### Step 3: Sentiment Analysis and Model Building
- Perform sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) tool.
- Plot histograms of compound scores obtained from VADER to analyze the distribution.
- Encode sentiment labels generated by VADER for further analysis and model building.
- Implement bag of words representation for feature extraction.
- Train various machine learning models including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classifier, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Random Forest to classify sentiment.
### Step 4: Model Evaluation and Deployment
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.
- Tune hyperparameters of the models using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to optimize performance.
- The Logistic Regression model achieved the highest accuracy of 90.07% using RandomizedSearchCV.
- The Decision Tree model achieved the second-highest accuracy of 88.9% using GridSearchCV.
- Deploying the decision tree model using Streamlit for interactive sentiment analysis.
